# UX-UI-SimpleShop
Experimenting with inventory management.

The core objective of this project is to provide users with an interactive platform for buying and selling items within a limited inventory space. Through an intuitive interface, players can explore the shop's ever-changing inventory, make purchases, and manage their acquired items.

Equipped with a backpack, players can strategically select and store purchased items, effectively managing their limited space. However, recognizing the inherent challenge of inventory constraints, the project includes an opportunity to upgrade the backpack's capacity through in-game purchases from the shop itself.

To maintain a balanced economy, players have the option to sell back items to the shop, making room for new acquisitions while earning fair compensation. Additionally, the project offers a chest where players can store selected items from their backpack, ensuring their safekeeping for future endeavours.
